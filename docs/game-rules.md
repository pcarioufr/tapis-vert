# Tapis Vert - Top 10 Game Rules

Tapis Vert implements the classic **Top 10** party game, a creative social game where players use numbered cards (1-10) to give answers that match their secret card value on a themed scale.

## Game Overview

Top 10 is a creative party game where:
- Each player receives a secret numbered card (1-10)
- The master provides a themed scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best)
- Players give creative answers that match their card number
- The master tries to guess which player has which number
- Success is measured by creativity, humor, and clever interpretation

## Setup

### Room Creation
- Games take place in **rooms** with unique identifiers
- Players join rooms via direct links or QR codes
- Each room can host multiple players simultaneously

### Player Roles
- **Masters**: Control the game flow, start rounds, manage players
- **Players**: Active participants who receive and interact with cards
- **Watchers**: Observers who can chat but don't receive cards
- **Visitors**: Unauthenticated users with limited interaction

### Authentication
- **Magic Links**: Players authenticate using unique codes for full access
- **Guest Mode**: Visitors can observe without authentication
- **Persistent Sessions**: Authenticated players maintain their identity across sessions

## Game Mechanics

### Round Structure
Each round of Top 10 follows this pattern:
1. **Card Distribution**: Each player receives a secret card (1-10)
2. **Theme Announcement**: Master provides a themed scale
3. **Answer Phase**: Players give answers matching their card value
4. **Guessing Phase**: Master attempts to match players to numbers
5. **Reveal**: Cards are revealed and results discussed

### Card Distribution
- When a round starts, numbered cards (1-10) are shuffled randomly
- Each **player** (not watchers) receives exactly one card
- Cards are dealt face-down and remain secret to other players
- Players can peek at their own card privately
- Card values determine the "intensity" of answers players should give

### Theme Structure
The master announces a theme following this format:
> "On a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is [worst quality] and 10 is [best quality], give me examples of [category]"

**Example themes:**
- "1 (most stupid) to 10 (most heroic) - ways to die"
- "1 (most boring) to 10 (most exciting) - weekend activities"  
- "1 (least scary) to 10 (most terrifying) - things found in a basement"
- "1 (most useless) to 10 (most essential) - superpowers"
