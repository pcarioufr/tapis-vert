# Tapis Vert - Developer & DevOps Documentation

This directory contains technical documentation for developers and DevOps engineers who want to understand, develop, deploy, and operate the Tapis Vert application.

## Overview

**Tapis Vert** is a real-time multiplayer implementation of the classic **Top 10** party game. Players receive numbered cards (1-10) and give creative answers that match their card's position on themed scales.

## Quick Architecture Summary

- **Backend**: Flask (HTTP API) + FastAPI (WebSocket) + Redis (data store & pub/sub)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with custom component system
- **Real-time**: WebSocket-based live updates for all game interactions
- **Authentication**: Magic link-based passwordless system
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with template-based configuration

- Common administrative tasks and best practices

## Development Setup

The application uses containerized development with "The Box" deployment system:

```bash
# From project root
cd box/
alias box=./box.sh

# Deploy for development
box deploy -n  # Dry run to check templates
box deploy     # Full deployment
```

See the main project README for complete setup instructions.

## Core Concepts

### Game Flow Implementation
1. **Room Management**: Players join rooms with unique IDs
2. **Card Distribution**: Redis-backed random assignment of 1-10 cards
3. **Real-time Sync**: WebSocket pub/sub for live game state updates
4. **Theme System**: Chat-based theme announcement (could be enhanced)
5. **Answer Collection**: Currently free-form chat (could be structured)
6. **Reveal Mechanism**: Card flip system for end-of-round reveals

### Technical Highlights
- **Custom JavaScript Framework**: No external dependencies, component-based
- **Redis-Centric**: All data in Redis with custom ORM abstraction
- **Real-time Native**: WebSocket-first architecture with auto-reconnection
- **Template-Based Config**: Environment variable replacement in all files
- **Monitoring Integration**: Datadog APM + RUM, Mixpanel analytics

## Development Guidelines

When modifying the application:

1. **Backend Changes**: Update both Flask (HTTP) and FastAPI (WebSocket) if needed
2. **Frontend Changes**: Follow the custom component patterns
3. **Data Model Changes**: Update the Redis ORM models and relationships  
4. **API Changes**: Update the API documentation
5. **Deployment**: Test template processing with `box deploy -n`

## Development Tools

- **Health Check**: Simple ping endpoint at `/ping`
- **Debug Mode**: Use `box -d` commands for verbose output
- **Log Monitoring**: Integrated Datadog logging and tracing
- **Admin Interface**: See [Admin Documentation](../admin/) for complete documentation
- **Infrastructure & Deployment**: See [Infrastructure Guide](infrastructure.md) for complete DevOps documentation

## Known Issues & TODOs

### API Validation
- **URGENT**: Add role validation to user PATCH endpoint (`/api/v1/rooms/<room_id>/user/<user_id>`)
  - Valid roles should be: `"master"`, `"player"`, `"watcher"`
  - Currently accepts invalid values like `"viewer"` without returning 400 error
  - This causes silent failures where users don't appear in rooms
  - **Location**: `services/webapp/flask/app/public/api/routes.py:room_user()`

### User/Card Management
- **ISSUE**: `this.eUsers[card.player_id].assignCard` error when card references non-existent user
- **ISSUE**: `this.data.users[card.player_id].name` error when card owner doesn't exist in users
- **Location**: `services/webapp/templates/public/room.jinja` card rendering logic (lines ~475, ~493)
- **Cause**: Cards reference player_ids that may no longer exist in room (user left, network issues, etc.)
- **Fix needed**: Add safe navigation (`?.`) or user existence checks before accessing user properties
- **Impact**: Causes JavaScript errors during room rendering, breaks game state display

### Redis ORM Issues
- **CRITICAL**: `patch()` vs `unflatten()` inconsistency causes object corruption
- **Problem**: `patch(key, "field:subkey", value)` creates nested fields without empty markers that `unflatten()` expects
- **Location**: `services/webapp/libs/redis-orm/core/mixins.py` (patch method) vs `core/utils.py` (unflatten method)
- **Impact**: Corrupts entire object when mixing patch nested syntax with normal field access - caused chat message regression
- **Trigger**: `room.patch(room_id, f"messages:{timestamp}", message, True)` broke room.cards data
- **Root Cause**: patch() documentation promises nested syntax support but doesn't create field markers that unflatten() requires
- **Current Workaround**: Messages stored as JSON blob in single field to avoid nested field corruption
- **TODO**: After fixing ORM nested field handling, migrate messages to proper ORM array structure

### Message Storage Architecture  
- **Current Implementation**: Messages stored as JSON blob in `room.messages` field
- **Reason**: Temporary workaround for Redis ORM nested field corruption issue
- **Technical Debt**: JSON blob approach bypasses ORM benefits (type safety, relationship handling, atomic updates)
- **Future Enhancement**: Once ORM `patch()` vs `unflatten()` inconsistency is resolved, migrate to proper ORM array structure
- **Migration Path**: Implement message as separate model with Room relationship, or fix ORM to support native arrays

### Documentation
- **Document all valid role values** in API reference
- **Add input validation examples** to API documentation  
- **Document error codes** for invalid role assignments
