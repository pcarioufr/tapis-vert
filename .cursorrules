# Tapis Vert Project Rules

## Project Architecture
This is a cloud-native application with three layers:
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform on OpenStack (Infomaniak)
- **Application**: Docker Compose services (unified Flask app + WebSocket + Redis + Nginx)
- **Deployment**: "The Box" containerized environment

### Application Architecture
- **Unified Flask App**: Single Flask application with blueprint separation
  - Public blueprint: User-facing game functionality (/, /api, /api/auth)
  - Admin blueprint: System management (nginx-blocked, SSH tunnel only)
  - Authentication library: Shared auth system in libs/auth/
- **WebSocket Service**: FastAPI-based real-time communication
- **Security**: Admin access via SSH tunnel only (nginx blocks admin routes)

## Working Directory and Setup
Always work from the `box/` directory and set up the alias:
```bash
cd box/
alias box=./box.sh
```

Use `-d` flag for debug output: `box -d deploy`, `box -d terraform plan`, etc.
Use `-p port` flag for port exposure: `box -p 8000 admin tunnel` (maps host port to same container port)

## AI Assistant Workflow Limitations
**TTY Limitation**: The AI cannot run `box` commands directly due to TTY (terminal) requirements from SSH tunneling and Docker exec operations. When the AI needs to inspect Redis data, check logs, or run diagnostics:
- AI will prepare scripts (like `box/opt/adhoc.sh`) for inspection tasks
- User must run `box` commands manually and share the output
- AI can then analyze the output and provide insights
- This is a fundamental limitation of the sandboxed execution environment, not a bug

**What AI Can Do**: Regular file operations, git commands, grep/search, code analysis, documentation updates, etc.
**What Requires User**: `box` commands (deploy, ssh, admin, test), interactive operations, SSH tunnels

## Testing and Development
### Integration Testing
- **Full test suite**: `box test init` - Complete room/user/round integration test
- **Clean database**: `box test delete` - Wipe Redis for clean testing
- **Debug mode**: `box -d test init` - Run tests with debug output

### Ad-hoc Testing
- **Arbitrary scripts**: `box/opt/adhoc.sh` - Safe for Cursor to edit for temporary testing needs
- **Container environment**: Runs within box container with full access to services and configuration
- **Disposable**: This script is meant for experimentation and can be freely modified

## Admin Interface Access
Secure admin access via SSH tunnel (localhost only):
```bash
# Admin interface (user/room management)
box -p 8000 tunnel -r 8002  # Access via localhost:8000/admin/list

# RedisInsight (Redis GUI for debugging)
box -p 8001 tunnel -r 8003  # Access via localhost:8001/
```
Admin routes: `/admin/list` (dashboard), `/admin/api/*` (API)
RedisInsight: Full Redis GUI with key browser, CLI, and performance analysis

## Application Development Notes
### Flask Blueprint Architecture
- **Public Blueprint** (`app/public/`): Handles /, /api, /api/auth routes
  - Web routes: Game room interface, QR codes
  - API routes: Room management, game actions  
  - Auth routes: /api/auth/login, /api/auth/me, /api/auth/logout, /api/auth/test
- **Admin Blueprint** (`app/admin/`): Handles /admin, /admin/api routes
  - Web routes: Dashboard, Redis debugging interface
  - API routes: User/room CRUD, system management
  - Security: Nginx-blocked, SSH tunnel access only

### Authentication System
- **Location**: `libs/auth/` (library, not blueprint)
- **Usage**: `from auth import login, code_auth` 
- **Benefits**: Shared across blueprints, no route registration needed
- **QR Code Login**: Automatic URL cleanup removes ?code_id after authentication

### Template & Static Organization
- **Templates**: `templates/layout.jinja` (base), `components/` (reusable), `admin/` & `public/` (master templates)
- **Static Assets**: `static/fonts/`, `static/libs/`, `static/styles/` (unified organization)
- **Template Calls**: `render_template("admin/list.jinja")`, `render_template("public/room.jinja")`

## Infrastructure Operations (Terraform)
- State managed in Terraform Cloud (org: pcarioufr, workspace: tapis-vert)
- Always authenticate first: `box terraform login`
- Initialize: `box terraform init`
- Standard workflow: `box terraform plan` → `box terraform apply`
- Get IPs: `box terraform output public_ip_v4` / `box terraform output public_ip_v6`
- Remember to update DNS records after deployment

## SSH and Server Access
- Generate SSH keys: `box ssh -n`
- SSH access: `box ssh`
- Run remote commands: `box ssh "command"`
- SSH tunneling: `box ssh -L port:localhost:port`
- Configure SSH_HOST in `box/.env`

## Application Deployment Workflow

### Complete Deployment Process (REQUIRED ORDER):

#### 1. Code Deployment (pushes code to server)
**ALWAYS REQUIRED FIRST** - Code must be on server before any Docker operations:
```bash
box deploy                    # Full deployment 
box deploy -p webapp/         # Deploy webapapp directory (path relative to services/)
box deploy -p path/to/file    # Deploy single file (path relative to services/)
box deploy -n                 # Dry run (test without deploying)
```

#### 2. Docker Build (on remote server only, AFTER deployment)
**IMPORTANT**: Only run AFTER `box deploy` has pushed the updated code to server:
```bash
box ssh "cd services && docker compose build"           # Build all containers
box ssh "cd services && docker compose build flask"     # Build specific service
box ssh "cd services && docker compose pull"            # Pull updated base images
```

#### 3. Service Restart (final step, applies changes)
```bash
box ssh "cd services && docker compose down && docker compose up -d"    # Restart all
box ssh "cd services && docker compose restart flask"                   # Restart specific
```

### Critical Notes:
- **NEVER skip step 1** - `box deploy` must happen first to get code on server
- **Docker builds happen on remote server only** - Never run locally  
- **Order matters**: Deploy → Build → Restart

## Configuration Management
- Uses centralized configuration in `config/.env` with two sections:
  - Manual configuration (OpenStack credentials, application settings)
  - Auto-generated section (Terraform outputs like IP addresses)
- Configuration is loaded by `box/opt/main` and exported to all scripts
- Config file is mounted in box container for read/write access
- `services/.env` is auto-generated from config variables during deployment
- Template files use `{{variable}}` syntax and ALL files are processed for templates during deployment (source files stay untouched)
- Terraform outputs are automatically written back to config/.env after successful apply
- DNS records can be synced with Infomaniak API using `box dns sync`

## Important Notes
- Deployment only pushes code - services keep running in previous state  
- **Docker builds happen on remote server only** - Never run `docker build` or `docker compose build` locally
- Always restart services manually after deployment to apply changes
- The Box provides all deployment tools - don't use terraform or docker directly

## Deployment Best Practices
- **Prefer minimal deployments**: Use `box deploy -p path` for scoped changes instead of full deployments
- **Partial deployment support**: Use `box deploy -p nginx/nginx.conf` for single files or `box deploy -p flask` for directories
- **For single file changes**: Use `box deploy -p path/to/file` for efficient targeted deployments
- **Service restart strategy**: Only restart affected services, not entire stack

## When User Asks To:
- **Setup project**: Tell them to copy config/example.env to config/.env and edit values
- **Deploy infrastructure**: Use terraform commands (plan → apply → output IPs)
- **Deploy application**: Use `box deploy` for full deployment or `box deploy -p path` for partial deployments, then remind about service restart
- **Update single file**: Use `box deploy -p path/to/file` for efficient targeted deployment
- **Update config**: Edit config/.env, then use `box deploy` to apply changes
- **Update DNS**: Use `box dns update`
- **Access server**: Use `box ssh`
- **Check application**: SSH in and use docker compose commands
- **Access admin interface**: Use `box -p 8000 tunnel -r 8002` then visit `http://localhost:8000/admin/list`
- **Access RedisInsight**: Use `box -p 8001 tunnel -r 8003` then visit `http://localhost:8001/`
- **Debug admin service**: SSH to server and curl `http://localhost:8002/admin/api/ping`
