# Tapis Vert Project Rules

## Project Architecture
This is a cloud-native application with three layers:
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform on OpenStack (Infomaniak)
- **Application**: Docker Compose services  
- **Deployment**: "The Box" containerized environment

## Working Directory and Setup
Always work from the `box/` directory and set up the alias:
```bash
cd box/
alias box=./box.sh
```

Use `-d` flag for debug output: `box -d deploy`, `box -d terraform plan`, etc.

## Infrastructure Operations (Terraform)
- State managed in Terraform Cloud (org: pcarioufr, workspace: tapis-vert)
- Always authenticate first: `box terraform login`
- Initialize: `box terraform init`
- Standard workflow: `box terraform plan` → `box terraform apply`
- Get IPs: `box terraform output public_ip_v4` / `box terraform output public_ip_v6`
- Remember to update DNS records after deployment

## SSH and Server Access
- Generate SSH keys: `box ssh -n`
- SSH access: `box ssh`
- Run remote commands: `box ssh "command"`
- SSH tunneling: `box ssh -L port:localhost:port`
- Configure SSH_HOST in `box/.env`

## Application Deployment Workflow

### 1. Code Deployment (pushes code only, doesn't restart services)
- Full deployment: `box deploy`
- Dry run (test without deploying): `box deploy -n`
- Specific directory: `box deploy -d webapp`
- Configuration patch: `box deploy -p .env`

### 2. Service Restart (separate step, always required after deployment)
```bash
box ssh
cd services/
docker compose down && docker compose up -d
# OR restart specific services:
# docker compose restart webapp
```

## Configuration Management
- Uses centralized configuration in `config/.env` with two sections:
  - Manual configuration (OpenStack credentials, application settings)
  - Auto-generated section (Terraform outputs like IP addresses)
- Configuration is loaded by `box/opt/main` and exported to all scripts
- Config file is mounted in box container for read/write access
- `services/.env` is auto-generated from config variables during deployment
- Template files use `{{variable}}` syntax and ALL files are processed for templates during deployment (source files stay untouched)
- Terraform outputs are automatically written back to config/.env after successful apply
- DNS records can be synced with Infomaniak API using `box dns sync`

## Important Notes
- Deployment only pushes code - services keep running in previous state
- Always restart services manually after deployment to apply changes
- Configuration managed centrally in `config/` directory
- The Box provides all deployment tools - don't use terraform/docker directly

## When User Asks To:
- **Setup project**: Tell them to copy config/example.env to config/.env and edit values
- **Deploy infrastructure**: Use terraform commands (plan → apply → output IPs)
- **Deploy application**: Use `box deploy` then remind about service restart
- **Update config**: Edit config/.env, then use `box deploy -p .env` if needed
- **Update DNS**: Use `box dns update`
- **Access server**: Use `box ssh`
- **Check application**: SSH in and use docker compose commands

## File Structure
- `terraform/`: Infrastructure as code
- `services/`: Application services and Docker Compose
- `box/`: Deployment environment and scripts
- `config/.env`: Single configuration file with all environment variables
