> **An online implementation of the classic Top 10 party game for groups of friends**

Tapis Vert brings the beloved **Top 10** party game to the web with real-time multiplayer features. Players receive secret numbered cards (1-10) and give creative answers that match their card's position on themed scales. The master tries to guess who has which number in this hilarious game of creativity and deduction!

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### 🎮 **Want to Play?**
1. Get a room link from a friend or create your own room
2. Visit the link in your browser - you'll get a visitor ID automatically
3. Wait for the master to start a new round and receive your secret card
4. Give creative answers that match your card number!
5. See **[Game Rules](docs/game-rules.md)** for complete instructions

### 💻 **Want to Deploy Your Own?**
```bash
# Quick deployment (requires config setup)
cd box/ && alias box=./box.sh
box terraform plan && box terraform apply
box deploy
box ssh "cd services && docker compose up -d"
```
See **[Infrastructure Guide](docs/dev-ops/infrastructure.md)** for complete setup.

### 🧰 **Prerequisites**

The **Box** (`box/box.sh`) is the project's dev/ops/test CLI toolbox — it handles deployment, infrastructure, SSH access, testing, and more. It is designed for macOS but could be adapted to Linux.

Requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then run setup to install dependencies (Docker Desktop, Node.js, Terraform, etc.):
```bash
cd box/ && ./box.sh --setup
```
